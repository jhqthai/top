        <p>Something about Vietnamese fried chicken </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            1kg (2 lb) chicken wings*<br>
            Vegetable oil, for deep-frying<br>
            1½ cups corn flour (cornstarch)<br>
            1 tsp baking powder<br>
            2 tbsp fried garlic<br>
            2 tbsp finely chopped coriander (cilantro)<br>
        </p>
        
        <p><strong><em>Marinate</em></strong></p>
        <p>
            1 tbsp fish sauce <br>
            1 tsp garlic powder <br>
            1 chicken stock cube, crumbled <br>
            1 tsp ground white pepper <br>
        </p>
        
        <p><strong><em>Sweet & salty sauce</em></strong></p>
        <p>
            3 tbsp fish sauce <br>
            2½ tbsp sugar <br>
            2 tbsp lime juice <br>
            3 small red chillies, finely sliced <br>
        </p><br>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>&nbsp;In a large bowl, place the chicken wings with all the marinade ingredients. Mix until well combined. Set aside while you prepare the sauce. </li>
                <li>&nbsp;To make the sweet & salty sauce, place the ingredients in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the sugar has just dissolved. Set aside to cool. </li>
                <li>&nbsp;Fill a wok or saucepan to about 1/3 capacity with the vegetable oil. Heat over high heat. The oil is hot enough when a wooden spoon dipped into the oil forms little bubbles. You don’t want to heat the oil too much because the chicken needs time to cook without burning. </li>
                <li>&nbsp;Meanwhile, mix the corn flour and the baking powder in a large bowl. Coat each chicken wing in the corn flour mixture, being sure to tap off any excess. Cook the chicken (do this in batches) for about 15 minutes or until golden. Drain on a wire baking rack.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;Wait a couple of minutes for the oil to heat up again. This time you want the oil very hot (you should have furious bubbles when you test with the wooden spoon). Add the chicken wings back into the oil and cook for another 2 minutes or until super crispy and deeply golden. Drain on paper towel. </li>
                <li>&nbsp;Just before serving, toss the chicken in the sweet & salty sauce, along with the fried garlic and coriander. Serve immediately. </li>

# Basic recipe

A basic recipe website to demonstrate my web development skill.  
- At this moment I've only learned basic HTML. 
- I'm looking to being able to create a basic HTML website from the experience.  

Reflection:
- I'm  able to design a basic webpage using HTML. The webpage contains images, paragraphs, lists.
- I'm commenting my changes on git properly.
- I'm able to deploy the webpage on the www using github page.
- This is fun :)
